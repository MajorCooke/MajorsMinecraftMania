# Major's Minecraft Mobs (Triple Em)
Adds Minecraft monsters to GZDoom.

[Original source models used for this mod can be found here.](https://github.com/22i/minecraft-voxel-blender-models)
Some have been heavily modified for use in Triple Em.

This mod requires [MC_Utility.pk3](https://github.com/MajorCooke/MC_Utility) to run, for now. Simply load it before this mod in the launcher of choice.
