/*==============================================================================
Pigmen/Piglin
 
Mobs that want to be left alone and will attack players/mobs based on conditions.
They will attempt to pick up items dropped by other monsters, including weapons.
Items can be recovered if killed.

-- Aggravation --
* Light 
	Players without gold that get too close will punch the player away from
	them. They will attempt to move away afterwards. Cannot kill the player, but
	can knock them around. Players getting within a medium range will cause piglins
	to look at them, possibly drawing their weapons, but they will usually strike
	with their fists.
** Cleared by running out of range or around a corner.

* Medium 
	Inadvertently damaging piglins with explosion damage will make the victims 
	close in and strike the player with their weapons once, but will not attempt
	to hit them again, but will stare at the player for a while and won't retreat.
	Other piglins may join in.
** Cleared by going away or healing the piglin

* Heavy
	Directly damaging a piglin will get them angry, and they won't stop until
	one party dies.
** Cleared by killing all the aggravated piglins

Monsters that damage Piglin are treated always given heavy treatment.


-- Drops --
Large health/armor

-- Relationships --
Hate/Fear:
- Undead monsters (depending on hunting or not)
