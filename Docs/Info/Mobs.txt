- Monster Information -
================================================================================
Monsters can spawn anywhere and at any time. While they do not combust 
spontaneously when walking outside, they do take damage from damage floors and
are instantly killed by crushers. They cannot trigger any line/sector actions
since they would otherwise break sensitive maps, but they can teleport.

Special DOOM-specific Behaviors included:
* Die instantly to crushers
* Take damage from damaging floors (except fire immune) (toggleable)
* Take fall damage (toggleable)
* Can drown (toggleable)
* Do not drop anything if not damaged by a player before death
* Never triggers line/sector/action specials, and cannot be assigned specials
* Spawn on 3D floors
* Don't spawn in sectors connected with SkyViewpoints

Any monster will attempt to spawn at a distance from the player. Without certain
conditions, they will also despawn with a chance that grows the further the player
is away from them. They will attempt to spawn in safe areas where they cannot
naturally be damaged, if sector damage is enabled in the option menu. But if it's
disabled, they can spawn in any sector regardless of the floor having damage or
not.

When a player is damaged by a Minecraft enemy, they become immune for half a 
second to damage coming from them. That means it's possible for a player to become
immune to an explosion from a creeper that would otherwise annihilate them if a
zombie were to melee them. This is not a bug - it's a feature. =P

***** Monsters *****
=== Zombies ===
Type: Undead
= Regular =
This cumbersome beast is slow moving, yet hits quite hard if his grabby hands
get around your limbs. As they're undead, they're rather tough with stamina but
are also bumbling and, well, quite brain dead.

* Undead
- Natural armor: 8% damage reduction
- Chance to call other zombies to help from all around when damaged
+ Slow
+ Moves straight towards foes, good for exploding in groups


= Baby =
Half the size of zombies, these guys spawn rarely but are harder to kill due to
size.

- 50% faster than adults
+ Explosion/Slime/Fire damage doubled against them
+ Doesn't spawn with armor or weapons

=== Skeletons ===
Type: Undead
= Regular =
How these things can act without meat is probably demonic in nature. Having shed
their rotten exoskeleton, these creatures are more nimble but also more brittle
than their cousin counterparts. They wield bows and prefer to keep a distance 
from their foes, backing away when within a certain range of the enemy.

Differences from Minecraft:
* They're a bit smarter in this mod. Whenever their arrows hit an unintended
	target, and the target goes after them in turn, they'll turn their full
	attention towards them and attempt to finish them off quickly.
	
+ No natural resistance
+ Immune to Regeneration
- Immune to Poison, Drowning
- Can hold and shoot arrows of varying effects

= Wither =
An ashen skeleton resurrected via Hell magic or from souls in the Nether. 
Skeletons that are destroyed via fire damage are imbued and reconstructed in the
Nether, and given swords as more powerful foes which makes them dangerous up close.

+ Melee only variant
+ No armor
+ Immune to regeneration
- Can spawn with 1-2 swords, increasing damage
- Stronger, faster
- Immune to fire, poison, slime


=== Creeper ===
Type: None
A failed pig-monster with camoflauge green skin and an explosive temper (quite 
physically), these walking PTSD trigger creatures make like a dog's fart upon 
arrival: silent, and deadly, save for the soft hiss...

But you're Doomguy! You can outright kill ANYTHING! Right? ...Right?

- Big explosions
- Silent except for hissing
- Can explode when dropping over an edge when taking fall damage
- Always explodes if dying by falling
+ Explosions deal extra damage to non-minecraft enemies (player is immune to this)

=== Enderman ===
Type: None
An alien creature that naturally isn't hostile to anything, unless attacked or
looked at the head. When angered, staring at their head will make them hold still.

- Increased health, damage, speed and can teleport
+ Neutral until attacked or stared at in the head
+ No armor or immunities


=== Spider ===
Type: Arthropod
An abnormally large arachnopod that triggers arachnophobia, by leaping at enemies.

- Leaps at enemies
- Moves through obstacles
- Smaller in height
- Can spawn with Strength, Speed, Regeneration and/or Invisibility. (Hard mode)
+ Bigger in radius, vulnerable to explosions & Bane of Arthropods
+ Can fall off cliffs and kill itself.

=== Ghast ===
Type: None
A big floating monster that moves in a sporadic manner and shoots fireballs from
long distances.

- Immune to fire, slime and damage sectors
- Fireballs ignite the ground if close enough
+ Press "use" on the fireballs when close enough to reflect them
+ Reflected fireballs insta-kill ghasts
+ Slow, easy targets for hitscans


=== Blaze ===
Type: None
Floating fire elemental that shoots fire charges which ignites anything they hit,
including setting the ground on fire. This is the result of a soul combined with
the Nether flame.

- Immune to fire, slime and damage sectors
+ Vulnerable to water sectors (if they don't deal sector damage themselves)

=== Piglin ===
Greedy pig-like anthropomorphs who like to hunt and hoard gold. They hunt in 
packs and support each other, never infighting with their own. Comes in melee
and crossbow variants.

* Neutral until personal space is invaded or attacked
+ Flees from Ziglins and packs of Hoglins
+ Flees from players who kill one of them briefly
- Can wear armor and weapons
- May come with Piglin Brutes
- Last Piglin may evolve into a Piglin Brute

=== Ziglin ===
Zombified Piglins (AKA Ziglins) are repentant souls of Piglins that have given up
their greed. But they won't hesitate to go all out and gang up on anyone that
attacks them as a whole mob. Piglins are no exception.

* Undead
+ Neutral until attacked
- Immune to fire, slime, damage sectors
- Pulls other ziglins in to fight with it (if they have line of sight) when 
	attacked

================================================================================
	MINIBOSSES
	
Come loaded for bear. Have a rocket launcher with plenty of booms or several TNT
blocks at the least, because these guys will destroy you.
================================================================================
=== Zoglin ===
Rage burns within upon seeing the last of its fellow Hoglin fall, becomes a 
living ball of rage and insane strength, belching flamees out of gaping wounds.

* Undead
+ Attacks everything it sees except Hoglins
- Tosses enemies into the air, disrupting aim
- Charges enemies and knocks them back
- Massive fiery death explosion

=== Piglin Brute ===
Powerful Piglin that can spawn or evolve from a Piglin. Both are rare events.
Extremely violent monster that deals a lot of damage with its axe.

- Always spawns with an axe
+ Hates all mobs that aren't piglins, especially undead.
