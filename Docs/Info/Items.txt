	Passive Items
================================================================================
These items have no functionality outside of simply being collected and cannot
be selected or used.

	* Resource Pearls *
Special pearls drop from different monsters. The pearls are:

- Health Pearls -
Blue cross pearls that restore health, acting like item bonuses.

- Armor Pearls -
Green shield pearls that give armor, also as item bonuses. 

These give BLUE armor types, allowing players to fair better against hordes of 
enemies, and will automatically convert armors to the strongest variant in the
game.

- Ammo Pearls -
Yellow pearls that give ammo of a random type. Randomness is determined by the
max amount that can be carried. The greater the amount, the higher chance to
add to it.

Ammo types are excluded if they are:
- Maxed out (Full)
- Without a weapon which consumes them

This will ensure the player is always getting ammo evenly distributed throughout
their current arsenal for fairness.

	Active Items
================================================================================

These items can be activated via the inventory.

	* TNT *

Behaving similarly to Minecraft, these blocks will explode after a short activation
delay, or an even shorter fuse when shot or detonated with explosive damage.

Any damage from the player will trigger a quick detonation. Only certain damage
types from monsters can set off the TNT as well (primarily explosions).

BLOCK mode allows players to place them almost anywhere they wish. Can even jump
on them or build bridges out of them. Just pray a cyberdemon isn't around to
troll.

Deals maximum 200 damage to players, 1000 to everything else.

TOSS mode immediately throws ignited TNT blocks that will explode shortly after.

Sub Mode is the timer, cycling between 1 and 4 seconds. Each cycle adds a second.
When at 4, goes back to 1. Use the keybinds in the Minecraft menu to switch (sub)
modes.
