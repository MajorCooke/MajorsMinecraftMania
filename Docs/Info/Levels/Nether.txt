To get there...

Obsidian drops rarely from mobs, with the highest chance coming from endermen. 
Only one block drops at a time. By themselves, obsidian is useless. But once 10 
are collected, a Construction Star becomes available in your inventory. 
Highlighting it will show block previews of the portal and all its blocks for 
placement.

Portal Construction tips:
- The portal will self destruct if the ground or ceiling move into the location
	of the portal. Any progress on the invasion waves will be for naught, but
	the star is refunded.
- Any blocks that are red means something is obstructing the portal's placement.
- Make sure to place it in an area with lots of room and is completely clear of
	other enemies to maximize survivability.
- All other mobs will vanish when the invasion begins to keep the fight fair.
- If the portal was put in a bad place, you can undeploy it after clearing the 
	enemies. The invasion only needs to be fought once, but upon exiting the
	current map means they'll need to be fought again.
- Don't worry about Health & Armor unless they go up past 200 in the mods played
	with. Both will be maximized upon entering the level each time.

- Netherland -

The Nether is an outpost of Hell, and this specific region is constructed for 
the purpose of containing souls of all the victims these demons slaughter. 
Unlike different areas of the Nether, these regions are closed off from the often
aimless tunnel areas, as evident from the enormous lake of fire surrounding this
mountain.

Someone didn't want this place to be easily accessed, hence the hordes of undead
and warrior piglins you'll have to slaughter to get into this sector.

At the heart of this region is a sunken pit, a plateau of glamour, with a plinth
containing something powerful. But the entire place is shielded off, with three
possible keys in three different areas. Only one is needed to hit the switch and
destroy the shield. At the same time, it'll shut down  the infernal machine
pulling all the dead from the Overworld down to here, making it your priority.

Beware... All the paths are equally difficult, it's just a matter of which one
you want to tackle.

Exploration Map

+ Fewest enemy encounters
- VERY BROAD region, with lots of exploration required

--- Enemies ---
* Ghasts (U)
* Wither Skeletons (U)
* Blazes

--- Hazards ---
* Unkillable ghosts
* Quick Soul Sand & Soil
* Soul Fire
* Soul Lava

The west region is filled with soul sand and soil. This is where all the souls 
are being stored, with indentured servants carrying the encased souls into this
multi-layered cavern. This place is vast, marked by the occasional cyan flame of
damnation, and soul lava.

Soul sand slows down any (un)living entity that walks through, as the souls try
to grasp at physical entities in an effort to have them pull the soul out of
their prison. This wouldn't be a problem if there aren't monsters chasing you.
They are few in number here, but they're the least of your concerns. The immortal
spirits that haunt the area will hunt you down if you don't run. Avoid them at
all costs and keep moving.

The most dangerous opponents here are the Blazes. A single fireball can ignite 
into Soul Fire, which bypasses all armor. Ghasts are very rare, but they're the
WORST. Their fireballs can ignite multiple blocks around them, spelling certain
death for a careless marine.

But the biggest challenge is finding the key. It could be on any layer, top or
bottom, surrounded by Soul Lava and a Wither Skeleton mob spawner that will take
a lot of fire power to destroy. If victorious, the threat will cease and the key
is yours for the taking.

Siege Mission

* Balanced between exploration and combat

--- Enemies ---
All Nether Enemies
All Piglins (U)

--- Hazards ---
* Soul Fire Lake
* Lava Eruptions
* Traps

The souls of the dead go here to be encased in Soul Sand, which is then sent to
the Valley afterwards. A giant device of nether magic emits a column of cyan,
materializing their prison and trapping them within.

This region is effectively a siege mission: break through the defenses and 
destroy the processor to retrieve the key. Simple, but Hellishly difficult.

To start off, the outermost defense is the surrounding nether fortress. Blazes
spawn out the wazoo and rain fire down upon intruders, while the skeletons come
to celebrate the skewing of your innards. An impenetrable shield surrounds the
bastion, which will fail only without the mob spawners. Destroy them to proceed.

In the midst of a bastion surrounding the soul processor is the Golden Armada.
No, not that one - the piglins all clad in enchanted golden armor. The bastion
itself is armed to the teeth, featuring witches that help run the device. This
area holds a legion of soldiers, but also many prisoners - including hoglins and
zoglins.

Penetrating the main gate is suicidal simply because of the overwhelming pigpower
they possess, of metal, blade and magic - but you can turn the tides in your
favor through subterfuge. Unleashing the caged is a good tactic, but don't get
caught in the infighting. It's possible to blast your way through, but make sure
you're loaded for bear. And unless you're capable of killing them in one hit, DO
NOT attack the monsters with thorns enchantment!

If you unleash temporary aid, you have several options at your disposal, but you
can only let loose one kind. The lever has been drastically rusted and will break
after just one use, so choose wisely.

* Hoglins & Zoglins
	Will run rampant and launch many a piglin into the air, guaranteeing many
	will be flung into the lava. However, zoglins are treachorous foes whose
	undeath state has defiled their sense of judgment and will attack all but
	themselves. They'll prioritize the army over you, allowing for you to get
	a massive window of opportunity to strike at the witches directly, but be
	fast. They won't last long, especially with infighting among themselves.
	At most, they'll be able to take out 1/2 of the occupying army.
	
* Overworld Undead
	Make no mistake: Piglins and undead HATE each other, except Ziglins since
	they were brethren. Opening a portal to Overworld's deepest caverns will
	belch a tidal wave of undeath INTO the Nether, a perverted invasion. This
	will lock the Processor in a state that can only be undone by destruction.
	The waves of undeath will serve as a distraction for the guard towers, and
	all the sharp shooters will be drawn into raining down steel, removing them
	as a threat. The Piglin army will slowly be overwhelmed by the endless waves,
	however. If the undead succeed, they'll start turning the souls into more
	undead that you will have to fight through, making it harder to reach the
	spire, but they're weaker than the piglins at least. Destroy the device to
	close the portal. But hurry! Time is your enemy. Strike when both sides
	are weakest, or you will be overwhelmed.
	
* B.F.C. (BOSS)
	Big Fucking Gun? Meet the Big Fucking Creeper. Unleashing this tormented
	monstrosity guarantees the destruction of the army... and potentially, you.
	An experimental beast infused with unholy magic by witches, this bitch has
	more than it takes to destroy all the piglins by belching up endless creepers.
	While she lays siege to the Bastion, STAY OUT OF HER WAY, or better still,
	stay outside the keep while she unleashes Hell on them all. But the witches
	know better... They know you unleashed her, so they tie the force field
	protecting the device to her life force before running away. Kill them before
	they escape the island for some massive bonus goodies - you'll need them.
	
	While she can be harmed, she is undying. Follow her out the huge hole she'll
	make in the bastion to where more souls swirl, waiting in line to enter the
	bastion. As you battle her, the souls will occasionally bombard her with 
	Soul Fire. Lure her over the flames before they go out, which will negate her
	regeneration so long as she's engulfed in the cyan heat. Be careful - the
	lower her health, the more she spams TNT and creepers. She is immune to fire,
	but not soul fire. Get the souls to bombard the lava pits around the place and 
	either lure her into stepping over/into the lava carelessly, or let your guns
	knock her into it. Beware, the creepers spawned by her ALWAYS explode, so 
	check your distance. They also run constantly. Keep on the move and don't 
	allow her to pin you. Keep wailing on her until she dies.
	
* None
	You'll take the armada by yourself. The switch will not activate. But if you
	want an extra challenge, you can activate this after defeating the army, for
	fun. Maybe there's a reward to it...?

Regardless, the objective is clear: Destroy the device, recover the key. Then,
evacuate ASAP - the device was suppressing tectonic activity to keep the area
stable, thus lava will begin to rise and consume everything.

+ Linear
- Slaughterfest

--- Enemies ---
* All Nether Enemies
--- Hazards ---
* Fire

A path worthy of those who want to go out in a blaze of glory while rocking it
to Mick Gordon. 

This area in comparison is far smaller then the others, but packs far more
enemies. All of them are hostile towards you, and they do not infight. A vast
Hellfire furnace fueled by abyssal flames, the purple black fires of Hell's
Darkness are fatal to anything touching it. Avoid them, or if clever enough, use
them by knocking back enemies into the flames. 

Dead corpses brought here by the overworld's hostile undead will rain down into
the flames, specifically the soul fire. Upon splattering the bodies, the spirits
are reconstituted into more demonic undead. And they are ENDLESS, until you can
destroy the furnace. Bring your A game as you would the demons in your realm.

Tips for conquering this area:
* Keep Fire Resistance at level 3. This mitigates damage from abyssal fire down
	to 20 from insta-kill (without invulnerability)
* Focus on witches as they spawn, to maximize fire resistance. Keep an eye out
	for resistance potions too, to further cut damage intake.
* Blazes are a problem here. Aside setting the ground on fire, there's a chance
	that instead of extinguishing after a time, it upgrades into soul fire which
	is eternal until shot. Miniscule chance it becomes Abyssal, which cannot be
	put out by force but doesn't last forever (still a long time).
* Shoot the bodies as they fall to destroy them before they touch the soul fire
	This will free the spirit and prevent the furnace from building a minion
	with it, reducing the number of monsters you have to endure for that wave.
	Rockets are best. BFG rays are a very close second, if you time it right.

Managed to get a key? Nothing less is expected of a true Slayer. But there's a
BIG bonus for each extra key included. Care to test your mettle?

The switch can be activated multiple times to adjust how many keys to use when
constructing the Wither. Each key will increase the Wither's health substantially
and make it more aggressive, while also increasing rewards - specifically, the
number of nether stars it drops. When ready, jump into the pit where the base of
the Wither lies in wait. The boss will activate shortly after.

- Aftermath -
-------------
The Wither's violent bodily explosion will cause this region of the Nether to
collapse - lava pouring in from the roof, blocks falling, the whole area coming
down. One of the walls will break down. Jump onto the soul sand path, and activate
the Nether Star to gain a speed boost.

You have one minute to reach the portal and escape before the entire foundation
buckles and crushes you. Be on guard - lava will break through the cavern roof
which can slow you down, even if fire resistance is active.
