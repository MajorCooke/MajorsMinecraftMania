* Description *

This provides extra monsters to fight in the game that look and behave just like
their true Minecraft counterparts.

There are a few deviations that cannot be replicated due to engine differences,
but otherwise they behave similarly and add a variety of enemies to keep players
on their toes. In addition, there are a few levels with bosses, as well as one
custom boss. Who could it be...?

This mod was inspired by a dream I had where I was playing Doom Eternal, and 
various minecraft monsters suddenly began to appear and attack me in game. Thus,
this mod was born.
