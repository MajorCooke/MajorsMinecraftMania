- Monster Information -
================================================================================
Monsters can spawn anywhere and at any time. While they do not combust 
spontaneously when walking outside, they do take damage from damage floors and
are instantly killed by crushers. They cannot trigger any line/sector actions
since they would otherwise break sensitive maps, but they can teleport.

Special DOOM-specific Behaviors included:
* Die instantly from crushers
* Take damage from damaging floors (except fire immune) (toggleable)
* Take fall damage (toggleable)
* Can drown (toggleable)
* Do not drop anything if not killed by a player
* Never triggers line/sector/action specials, and cannot be assigned specials

Any monster will attempt to spawn at a distance from the player. Without certain
conditions, they will also despawn with a chance that grows the further the player
is away from them. They will attempt to spawn in safe areas where they cannot
naturally be damaged, if sector damage is enabled in the option menu. But if it's
disabled, they can spawn in any sector regardless of the floor having damage or
not.

When a player is damaged by a Minecraft enemy, they become immune for half a 
second to damage coming from them. That means it's possible for a player to become
immune to an explosion from a creeper that would otherwise annihilate them if a
zombie were to melee them. This is not a bug - it's a feature. =P

***** Monsters *****
=== Zombies ===
= Regular =
This cumbersome beast is slow moving, yet hits quite hard if his grabby hands
get around your limbs. As they're undead, they're rather tough with stamina but
are also bumbling and, well, quite brain dead.

- Natural armor: 8% damage reduction
- Chance to call other zombies to help from all around when damaged
+ Slow
+ Moves straight towards foes, good for exploding in groups


= Baby =
Half the size of zombies and 50% faster, these guys spawn rarely but are hard to
kill.

- 50% faster than regular
+ Explosion/Slime/Fire damage doubled against them


=== Skeletons ===
How these things can act without meat is probably demonic in nature. Having shed
their rotten exoskeleton, these creatures are more nimble but also more brittle
than their cousin counterparts. Rarely, zombie's can lose their flesh and turn
into one of these if damage is low enough. They wield bows and prefer to keep
a distance from their foes, backing away when within a certain range of the enemy.

Differences from Minecraft:
* They're a bit smarter in this mod. Whenever their arrows hit an unintended
	target, and the target goes after them in turn, they'll turn their full
	attention towards them and attempt to finish them off quickly.

+ No natural armor/resistance
- Immune to poison, drowning

=== Creeper ===
A failed pig-monster with camoflauge green skin and an explosive temper (quite 
physically), these walking PTSD trigger creatures make like a dog's fart upon 
arrival: silent, and deadly, save for the soft hiss...

But you're Doomguy! You can outright kill ANYTHING! Right? ...Right?

- Big explosions
- Silent except for hissing
- Can explode when dropping over an edge when taking fall damage
- Always explodes if dying by falling
+ Explosions deal extra damage to non-minecraft enemies (player is immune to this)

=== Enderman ===
An alien creature that naturally isn't hostile to anything, unless attacked or
looked at the head. When angered, staring at their head will make them hold still.

- Increased health, damage, speed and can teleport
+ No armor or immunities

=== Spider ===
An abnormally large arachnopod that triggers arachnophobia, by leaping at enemies

- Leaps at enemies
- Moves through obstacles
- Smaller in height
+ Bigger in radius, more vulnerable to explosions

=== Ghast ===
A big floating monster that moves in a sporadic manner and shoots fireballs.
