- Monster Information -
================================================================================
Monsters can spawn anywhere and at any time. While they do not combust 
spontaneously when walking outside, they do take damage from damage floors and
are instantly killed by crushers. They cannot trigger any line/sector actions
since they would otherwise break sensitive maps, but they can teleport.

Special DOOM-specific Behaviors included:
* Die instantly from crushers
* Take damage from damaging floors (except fire immune) (toggleable)
* Take fall damage (toggleable)
* Can drown (toggleable)
* Do not drop anything if not killed by a player
* Never triggers line/sector/action specials, and cannot be assigned specials

Any monster will attempt to spawn at a distance from the player. Without certain
conditions, they will also despawn with a chance that grows the further the player
is away from them. They will attempt to spawn in safe areas where they cannot
naturally be damaged, if sector damage is enabled in the option menu. But if it's
disabled, they can spawn in any sector regardless of the floor having damage or
not.

***** Monsters *****
=== Zombies ===
= Regular =
This cumbersome beast is slow moving, yet hits quite hard if his grabby hands
get around your limbs. As they're undead, they're rather tough with stamina but
are also bumbling and, well, quite brain dead.

+ Slow
+ Weakness: Head (+300% damage)
+ Burns in daylight (regardless of sky texture)
- Turns into a Drowned if submerged underwater long enough
- Natural armor: 8% damage reduction
- Chance to call other zombies to help from all around when damaged
- Chance to turn into a skeleton when critically hit

= Husk =
Same as regular but different skin. 
- Doesn't burn in daylight

= Drowned =
Zombies that drown become this waterlogged creature.

/ Doesn't burn in daylight but becomes passive instead


=== Skeletons ===
How these things can act without meat is probably demonic in nature. Having shed
their rotten exoskeleton, these creatures are more nimble but also more brittle
than their cousin counterparts. Rarely, zombie's can lose their flesh and turn
into one of these if damage is low enough. They wield bows and prefer to keep
a distance from their foes, backing away when within a certain range of the enemy.

Differences from Minecraft:
* They're a bit smarter in this mod. Whenever their arrows hit an unintended
	target, and the target goes after them in turn, they'll turn their full
	attention towards them and attempt to finish them off quickly. 
* Don't let them pick up other weapons! Otherwise, you'll have to deal with these
	rocket toting monsters... At least until they run out of ammo and then discard
	the weapon.

+ No natural armor/resistance
+ Weakness: Torso (+150% damage)
- Immune to poison, drowning

--- Creeper ---
A failed pig-monster with camoflauge green skin and an explosive temper (quite 
physically), these walking PTSD trigger creatures make like a dog's fart upon 
arrival: silent, and deadly, save for the soft hiss...

But you're Doomguy! You can outright kill ANYTHING! Right? ...Right?

...Say, what's with the spontaneous lighting strikes outside?

+ Weakness: Feet (+100% damage)
+ Weakness: Explosions (+200% damage)
- Big explosions
- Silent except for hissing
- Can explode when dropping over an edge when taking fall damage
- Always explodes if dying by falling

--- Spider ---
The itsy bitsy spider crawled up... another damn giant spider and tried to eat
everyone. They don't have any guns, phew... but they bite hard, leap, and climb
walls. Crap. 

They are also wide instead of tall, so they can get inside little slits. Beware.

+ Becomes passive in bright areas
- Can leap & climb walls

--- Cave Spider --
Smaller spiders with a smaller hitbox. Can poison their foes with their bites
on harder difficulties, but aren't as healthy.

+ Low health
+ Weak spot: Eyes (Instant death)
- Poisonous attack

--- Slime ---
Rare mobs that hop about. Depending on size is the damage radius and amount.
Splits into smaller slimes upon death. Skates very fast across water textures.

+ Only moves forward predictably and can fall off ledges
+ Burns easily, spreads fire/poison/wither to spawns
- Heavy damage
- Tanky
- No weak spots

--- Endermen ---
Tall lanky creatures that are passive until attacked or looked at on the head.

+ Takes damage from water surfaces, double from slime/lava
+ Negative status effects last twice as long
+ Weak spot: Mouth (+150% damage)
- Can teleport around to get out of danger and evade combat


--- Zombie Pigmen ---
Pack monsters that are generally neutral and don't attack. Spawns frequently
with hellish textures or later maps. They spawn in large packs and don't attack
unless attacked. Considering how big their packs usually are, one should avoid
hurting them if possible, but they'll forgive the player after a while.

Brandishing golden sword, they faster, hardier and more punishing than regular
zombies, so its wise to leave them be, but they drop quite a bit of resources 
if killed by players.

+ Neutral mob - doesn't attack anyone unless attacked
+ Drops more resources on death
+ Can forgive players, won't forgive mobs
+ Weak spot: Head (+300% damage)
+ Weak spot: Hand (Disarms when shot hard enough, lowering attack damage)
- Spawns in large packs
- ZERG- er, PIG SWARM!!!
- Immune to Fire

--- Magma Slime ---
Hellish variants of regular slimes.

+ Slower
- Hops very high
- Immune to Fire

--- Blaze ---
Floating monsters that cast infernal charges which sets fire to anything they
hit. Often spawns in packs, making them dangerous.

+ Doesn't move much horizontally
+ Tends to sink to the ground
- Immune to fire/fall damage

--- Ghast ---
Floating monsters that are huge and shoot bigger, explosive fireballs.

+ Big & slow enemy, easy to hit
+ Reflectable fireballs
+ Weakness: Fireballs (Instant death)
- Big fireballs that explode and set fire to the area around them
- Immune to Fire/Falling
- Can snipe from long ranges away

--- Wither Skeleton ---
Scorched by countless ages of Hellfire, the souls that infest them know nothing
but pain, and want nothing more than to share it with living mortal flesh - and
anyone insolent enough to attack them.

+ Weak spot: Head (+100% damage)
/ Death by weak spot prevents skull from dropping
- Inflicts Wither effect on attack
- Immune to Fire/Poison/Fall damage


	***** Bosses *****
	
--- Wither ---
A three headed eldritch abomination that attacks by launching floating skulls at
enemies. Has multiple phases.

PHASE 1
* Spawns in and generates health up to full, before emitting a massive explosion
that's guaranteed to be fatal to most enemies. Will attack most other enemies and
demons, including other undead, while also strafing players. Changes focus to 
enemies that attack it directly.

PHASE 2
* Becomes immune to explosion damage and long range projectiles, requiring 
direct contact damage to be large. Gets up REAL close and personal too, making 
it harder to dodge skulls.
